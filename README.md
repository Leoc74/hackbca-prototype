# hackbca-example-prototypes

These are prototypes for SOME (not all) of the pages for the hackbca example webapp.

The prototypes are built with the Materialize Framework (https://materializecss.com/)


## Working through this example:

If using VSCode, install the Live Server extension. 
Then, you can easily view any HTML file on your browser by right clicking and choosing "Open with Live Server."

Each HTML file contains comments referencing relevant Materialize documentation.

Start by working through the versions of the homepage, index.html, in the index_progress folder. 

Then, check out events.html, eventform.html, and events/1.html.
